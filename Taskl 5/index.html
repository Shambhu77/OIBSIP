                    Warne was born in the Melbourne suburb of Upper Ferntree Gully on 13 September 1969, the son of
                    Brigitte and Keith Warne.His mother was German.He attended Hampton High School from
                    Grades 7–9 before being offered a sports scholarship to attend Mentone Grammar, where he spent his
                    final three years of school.
                    At first there were nerves and chubbiness. Then came wild soaring legbreaks, followed by fame and
                    flippers. For a long while there were women, then a bookmaker, then diet pills, then more women -
                    and headlines, always headlines. Now he has come out the other end, his bluff and bluster and
                    mischief and innocence somehow intact. The man who in 2000 was rated among the five greatest
                    cricketers of the 20th century was, in 2006, bowling better than ever.
